# Session 3

Covers:

- MVVM motivation.
- MVVM from last signup demo FRP.
- MVVM with master/detail Xcode template.

## Next Steps

- Look for small view controllers to transition to MVVM. Ideally, they don't "lead" to any other view controllers. Something like a details VC that a user only leavecs by tapping a "back" button.
- Or, take any view controller you have and focus on a specific function. Put all the networking, or form validation, or image downloading into a view model.
