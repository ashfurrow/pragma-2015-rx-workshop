Reactive Programming Workshop
===

There are the materials for my [worksop on reactive programming on iOS](http://pragmaconference.com/workshops.html) on October 9, 2015, in Florence. The workshop is divided into four sessions, with Xcode proejcts, playgrounds, and READMEs in each directory. 

Ciao.
