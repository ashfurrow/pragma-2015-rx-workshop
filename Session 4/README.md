Session 4
=========

Covers:

- Definition of a unit test.
- Install Quick/Nimble, FBSnapshotTestCase, Nimble+FBSnapshotTestCase with CocoaPods.
- Adding tests to Signup and Entities demos from Session 3.
- Use protocol conformance and private functions to limit scope of view models.
- Dependency injection, lazy-loading view models.
- Stubbing view models for snapshot tests ([this plugin](http://github.com/orta/Snapshots) is useful).
- Testing view models individually.

## Next Steps

Make view models added in step 3 conform to new, constrained protocols. Make stub view models that conform so you can test view controllers with snapshots. Test the view models individually.
